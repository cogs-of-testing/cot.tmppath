# Changelog fragments

Every change a user of the package would notice adds one fragment here.
Each push to `main` renders them into a release proposal; see
`docs/releasing.md`.

Name a fragment `<issue or PR number>.<type>.md`, or `+<slug>.<type>.md`
when there is no number. The type sets the section and the version bump
(`towncrier-fragments-zerover`):

| type | section | bump on 0.x | bump from 1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `major` | Major Changes | 1.0.0 | major |
| `breaking` | Breaking Changes | minor | major |
| `removal` | Removed | minor | major |
| `deprecation` | Deprecated | minor | minor |
| `feature` | Added | minor | minor |
| `bugfix` | Fixed | patch | patch |
| `doc` | Documentation | patch | patch |
| `misc` | Miscellaneous | patch | patch |
